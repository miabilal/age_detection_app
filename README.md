# Flutter Age Detection App

A Flutter application that uses an image-based age detection API to estimate the age of individuals in photos. This app allows users to pick an image from their gallery and see the estimated age of detected faces.

## Features

- Pick an image from the gallery.
- Upload the image to the age detection API.
- Display detected ages for faces in the image.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
- A valid API key for the age detection service.

## Setup

### 2. Configure API Key
You need to obtain your own API key for the age detection service. Follow these steps:

Sign Up for an API key at RapidAPI.
Subscribe to the Age Detection API.
Replace the placeholder API key in the api_service.dart file with your own API key.
Open lib/api_service.dart and update the _apiKey and _apiHost values:

--final String _apiKey = 'your-api-key';  // Replace with your API key

For any issues or questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

### **Notes**

   - Update `your-api-key` and `your-api-host` with your actual API credentials.
